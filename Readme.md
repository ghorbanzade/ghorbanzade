# Hey, I'm Pejman

I am the Founder of [Touca], a developer tool that helps software engineers
see the true impact of their code changes on the behavior and performance of
their software.

Before Touca, I was a senior software engineer at Canon Medical Informatics,
building software for 3D visualization of medical images. Before that, I
worked at VMware Carbon Black, building and maintaining the macOS endpoint
for their Cb Defense product.

I am interested in problems related to the design and maintenance of
software at scale and over time. Specifically, I am passionate about
solutions to improve stability and maintainability of products with
large ever-changing codebases. Naturally, I love to learn about techniques
to refactor and test non-trivial applications.
