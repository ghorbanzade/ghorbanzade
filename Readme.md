# Hey, I'm Pejman

I am a senior staff software engineer at [Aurora](https://aurora.tech/company),
helping deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and
broadly.
I lead the engineering team behind the various web applications that are
critical to the development of our autonomy software.

Before joining Aurora, I was the founder and CEO of
[Touca](https://github.com/trytouca/trytouca), a developer-tools startup helping
engineering teams find the unintended side-effects of day-to-day code changes on
the behavior and performance of their software. Before that, I worked at Canon
Medical Informatics and VMware Carbon Black.

I am interested in problems related to the design and maintenance of software at
scale and over time. I am passionate about solutions to improve stability and
maintainability of products with large ever-changing codebases.

If you ever wanted to chat, I am pretty easy to find and talk to.
